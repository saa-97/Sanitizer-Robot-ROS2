# Sanitizer-Robot-ROS2

This project was developed for the final examination of the course Autonomous and Mobile Robotics for Master's degree in Automation Engineering at the University of Bologna.

The objective of this project was to implement a Sanitizer Robot to autonomously map, localize, navigate, and disinfect unknown environments with UV lamps for corona virus inactivation.

The project included 4 stages as depicted below:
